=====================================

********
Pyplines
********

``pypelines`` is a simple python framework for building data processing pipelines.

The main goal for pypelines is to make processing units as robust as it can be by making it:

| - Usable outside of the framework environment so you don't need redefine the processor logic when using this logic outside of the pipeline.
| - Testable.
| - Easily used in any desired order within the pipeline.
