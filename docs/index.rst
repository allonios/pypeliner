Pipliner
********

``pipeliner`` is a simple python framework for building data processing pipelines.

The main goal for pipeliner is to make processing units as robust as it can be by making it:

- usable outside of the framework environment so you don't need redefine the processor logic when using this logic outside of the pipeline.

- testable.

- easily used in any desired order within the pipeline.
